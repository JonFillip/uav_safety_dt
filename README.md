# UAV Safety Digital Twin: Predictive Analysis for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Safety

This repository extends the work from "When Uncertainty Leads to Unsafety: Empirical Insights into the Role of Uncertainty in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Safety" to create a comprehensive digital twin system for UAV safety prediction. The enhanced system combines uncertainty detection with kinematic safety assessment to predict future states and identify potential safety issues before they occur in real-world operations.

## Project Overview

The UAV Safety Digital Twin project aims to:

1. __Predict Future UAV States__: Forecast the UAV's position, orientation, and safety metrics for future time steps
2. __Quantify Uncertainty__: Provide confidence intervals and uncertainty metrics for all predictions
3. __Detect Anomalies__: Identify unusual patterns in flight data that may indicate safety concerns
4. __Explain Predictions__: Provide interpretable explanations for safety decisions using physics-based models
5. __Enable Real-time Monitoring__: Support real-time safety assessment and prediction during flight operations

The system integrates two complementary approaches:

- __SUPERIALIST__: An autoencoder-based anomaly detection system that identifies unusual patterns in orientation data
- __Kinematic Safety Analysis__: A physics-based approach that uses explicit kinematic features to assess safety

## System Architecture

The digital twin system consists of four main components:

### 1. Predictive Autoencoder

An enhanced version of the SUPERIALIST autoencoder that not only reconstructs current states but also predicts future states. The architecture includes:

- __Encoder__: Convolutional layers that extract features from orientation data
- __Temporal Predictor__: LSTM/GRU layers that capture temporal dependencies and predict future states
- __Decoder__: Transposed convolutional layers that reconstruct both current and predicted future states

### 2. Uncertainty Quantification

Multiple techniques to quantify uncertainty in predictions:

- __Ensemble Methods__: Multiple models with different initializations
- __Monte Carlo Dropout__: Enabled during inference to generate prediction distributions
- __Calibration Layer__: Maps model confidence to empirical accuracy

### 3. Kinematic Validation

Physics-based validation of neural network predictions:

- __Feature Attribution__: Connects neural network activations to physical quantities
- __Physics-Based Constraints__: Flags predictions that violate physical constraints
- __Explainability Layer__: Provides human-readable explanations for safety decisions

### 4. Real-Time Implementation

Optimizations for deployment in real-world settings:

- __Model Optimization__: Quantization and pruning for efficient inference
- __Incremental Learning__: Updates the model with new flight data
- __Visualization Dashboard__: Real-time display of current state, predicted future states, and uncertainty

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following top-level folders:

- __datasets__: Contains all datasets used for training and testing, including time-windowed datasets, manually labeled data, and feature-engineered datasets.

- __superialist__: Implementation of the SUPERIALIST approach, including the autoencoder code, trained models, and analysis scripts.

- __dataset_generation__: Code used to generate time-windowed datasets from flight logs.

- __surrealist_extension__: Customized settings for "surrealist" including the fitness function used to generate training data.

- __predictive_twin__: New module implementing the predictive digital twin capabilities, including future state prediction, uncertainty quantification, and real-time monitoring.
